# Aima-Ayaz-robotics-Portfolio
Portfolio for Robot Operating System (ITAI 2374)

Welcome to my professional portfolio for the Applied Artificial Intelligence & Robotics program.  
This repository highlights my academic and technical projects, showcasing skills in:

- Robotics development with ROS 2 and OpenCV  
- Machine learning and deep learning (PyTorch, TensorFlow)  
- Natural Language Processing (NLP) pipelines and ethical AI reflection  
- Edge computing, IoT integration, and Linux system administration  

Each project folder contains runnable code, documentation, and results that demonstrate both technical execution and professional presentation. My goal is to make complex ideas accessible through clear explanations, visuals, and structured workflows.

## 📂 Featured Projects
